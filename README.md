# Sudoku_maker
This is my first project! It creates a sudoku game, and you can choose your level of dificulty.

This is the first project I created for my portfolio, besides the ones I create during the Python classes.
Though I know it could be better in many ways, I wrote it all by myself, so it's a pretty honest way to show where I am.
If you have any tips on how to make it better, feel welcome to do it. I apreciate you help.

Next step is: create a GUi and make it 'playable'.
